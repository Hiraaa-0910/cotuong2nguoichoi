# 🎮 Xiangqi Game - Complete Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### ✅ Issue 1: Multiple Game Engine Conflicts
**Problem:** Three separate game initializations were running simultaneously
- `game.js` creating `new ChessGame()`
- `chess-game.js` creating another `new ChessGame()`  
- `hoan-chinh-co-tuong.js` creating `new CoTuongHoanChinh()`

**Impact:** 
- "New Game" button didn't work correctly
- Cannot switch between different boards
- Game functions were being overwritten

**Solution:** 
- ✅ Disabled `game.js` initialization (commented out lines 1150-1263)
- ✅ Disabled `chess-game.js` initialization (commented out lines 785-796)
- ✅ Set `hoan-chinh-co-tuong.js` as the ONLY active game engine

### ✅ Issue 2: newGame() Function Not Working
**Problem:** `newGame()` function in `main.js` referenced a non-existent `gameEngine` variable

**Solution:**
- ✅ Updated `main.js` newGame() to check for `window.coTuongGame` instance (primary)
- ✅ Added fallback to `gameEngine` for compatibility
- ✅ Added error handling with user-friendly notifications

### ✅ Issue 3: Piece Capture Mechanics
**Status:** ✅ Already implemented and working
- Captured pieces remove from board automatically
- Captured pieces display in the captured section
- Piece information stored in `capturedPieces` array
- Game detects when King (Tướng/將) is captured and ends game

### ✅ Issue 4: Turn Management
**Status:** ✅ Already implemented and working
- Turn enforcement prevents wrong player from moving
- Automatic turn switching after each move
- Turn display updates in real-time
- Error messages shown when player tries to move opponent's pieces

### ✅ Issue 5: Game Status Display
**Status:** ✅ Already implemented and working
- Current turn displayed at top
- Game status shows who's moving: "ĐỎ ĐANG ĐI" or "ĐEN ĐANG ĐI"
- Displays "⚡ CHIẾU TƯỚNG!" when in check

## Game Flow - How It Works Now

### 1. Page Loads
```
scripts load in order → hoan-chinh-co-tuong.js loads LAST
↓
window.coTuongGame = new CoTuongHoanChinh()
↓
Game board created with 32 pieces in starting positions
↓
Ready for play!
```

### 2. Player Makes Move
```
1. Click red piece → Select piece (only if red's turn)
2. Valid moves highlight
3. Click destination → Execute move
4. Check if capture:
   - YES: Remove captured piece from board + display in captured section
   - NO: Just move piece
5. Switch turn to black automatically
6. Update status display
7. Check for check/checkmate
```

### 3. Turn Switches Automatically
```
After move completes:
- currentPlayer switches from 'red' to 'black'
- capNhatHienThi() updates display
- Next player can now move
- If they try to move wrong color: "Bây giờ là lượt ĐỎ!"
```

### 4. Piece Capture Sequence
```
Player captures opponent's piece:
1. anQuan(capturedPiece) called
2. Remove from activePieces array
3. Remove from DOM (piece disappears)
4. Add to capturedPieces[color] array
5. Create icon in capturedRed or capturedBlack section
6. If King captured → End game, show winner
```
