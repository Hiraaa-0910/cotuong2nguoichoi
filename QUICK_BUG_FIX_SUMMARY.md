# ✅ CRITICAL BUGS FIXED - QUICK SUMMARY

## Two Major Issues - RESOLVED

### Issue #1: Duplicate Chessboards on "New Game"
**Status:** ✅ FIXED

**What was wrong:**
- Multiple boards appeared stacked when clicking "Ván mới" button
- Old board wasn't being completely cleared

**How we fixed it:**
- Enhanced `taoBanCo()` method with dual-layer clearing
- Uses both `removeChild()` loop AND `innerHTML = ''`
- Added validation and debug logging

**Location:** [js/hoan-chinh-co-tuong.js Line 51](js/hoan-chinh-co-tuong.js#L51)

### Issue #2: Piece Capture Not Working
**Status:** ✅ FIXED

**What was wrong:**
- Piece capture detection had faulty logic
- Multiple issues cascaded:
  1. Invalid move validation caught empty squares as "same color"
  2. Data validation happened AFTER using values
  3. Array not properly initialized

**How we fixed it:**
- **Fix #1 (Line 527):** Rewrote `kiemTraVaThemNuocDi()` logic to properly distinguish:
  - Enemy pieces (can capture)
  - Ally pieces (can't move there)
  - Empty squares (can move there)
  
- **Fix #2 (Line 658):** Enhanced `anQuan()` data validation:
  - Check dataset exists BEFORE using it
  - Validate all required fields
  - Better error reporting
  
- **Fix #3 (Line 700):** Proper array initialization:
  - Use null coalescing operator
  - Initialize array safely
  - Added logging for count

**Locations:**
- [js/hoan-chinh-co-tuong.js Line 527](js/hoan-chinh-co-tuong.js#L527) - Capture detection
- [js/hoan-chinh-co-tuong.js Line 658](js/hoan-chinh-co-tuong.js#L658) - Data validation
- [js/hoan-chinh-co-tuong.js Line 700](js/hoan-chinh-co-tuong.js#L700) - Array initialization

## How to Test

### Test Board Clearing
1. Make several moves
2. Click "Ván mới"
3. ✅ Should see: Single fresh board with 32 pieces
4. ✅ Check console: "✅ Fresh board created with 90 squares"

### Test Piece Capture
1. Select red pawn next to black pawn
2. Look for "CÓ THỂ ĂN" in console - capture option
3. Click that square
4. ✅ Black piece disappears from board
5. ✅ Black piece appears in "ĐEN bị ăn" section
6. ✅ Check console: "✅ Quân đã xóa khỏi DOM"

## Console Messages You'll See Now

### When Board Resets:
```
🔧 Clearing board and creating fresh 10x9 grid...
✅ Fresh board created with 90 squares
```

### When Capturing a Piece:
```
📍 [3,4] - CÓ QUÂN ĐỊCH (卒) - CÓ THỂ ĂN
⚔️ Ăn quân tại [3,4]
🍖 ĐANG ĂN QUÂN: Tốt (black) tại [3,4]
✅ Đã xóa quân khỏi activePieces (32 → 31)
✅ Quân đã xóa khỏi DOM tại ô [3,4]
✅ Thêm vào capturedPieces[black] (Tổng: 1)
